    "This FRQ enhanced my understanding of interfaces in Java and their role in defining a contract for classes to implement. The NumberGroup interface serves as a contract defining the behavior that classes like Range must implement. I also learned more about encapsulation as I encapusulated the start and end fields within the Range class which promoted better code organization and reduces the risk of unintended modifications by external classes. Overall, this FRQ deepened my understanding of Java programming concepts such as classes, interfaces, encapsulation, and testing methodologies, which builds up my Java skills.\n",
