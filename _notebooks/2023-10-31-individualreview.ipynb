    "I chose answer D, which was wrong since the methods of the superclass can be overridden in the subclass. Since the books array is declared of type Book, the compiler will check to see if Book has a length() method. Since Book has a length() method, there is not a compile time error. At run-time, the length() method in AudioBook will be executed since the object at books[0] is an AudioBook. The correct answer was actually B, Line 4 will not compile because variables of type Book may only call methods in the Book class.\n",

The correct answer was B, for the future I will focus more on working arraylists in relation to interfaces by watching collegeboared videos 2.7 and 7.4.\n",

    "# Trimester 1 Reflection\n",
    "Main learning from trimester 1 was definetly the learning of java, I already had a lot of experience with java and I knew most of the basic concepts such as arrays, arraylists, classess, and inheritance. Something which I really appreciated doing this trimester was definetly presenting 2D arrays. Previously I had absolutely no experience using 2D arrays, and not only did I learn about the topic I presented which I think solidified my learning of the topic even more. I also learned about polymorphism and inheritanced which really increased my world in java and can improve my code and projects a lot. Positive accomplishments that I think really happened was an increase in overral knowledge of java and more expereince in drivetrain with robots as I am in the robotics team. For future trimesters I intend to learn to learn the more complicated parts of Java including JavaDB so i can solidify and master my learning in java. In the future timesters I aim to imporve the project and improve my drivetrain code\n",
