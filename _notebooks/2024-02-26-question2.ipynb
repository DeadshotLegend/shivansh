    "### Solution\n",
    "The code simulates a word guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word. The getHint method provides hints based on the player's guesses, indicating correct letters in their correct positions, correct letters in incorrect positions, and incorrect letters. the getHint method compares each letter of the guessed word with the corresponding letter of the hidden word. Based on the comparison results, it constructs a hint string that indicates correct letters in their correct positions, correct letters in incorrect positions, and incorrect letters. Finally, it returns the hint string."
