    "### Solution\n",
    "The code simulates a word guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word. The getHint method provides hints based on the player's guesses, indicating correct letters in their correct positions, correct letters in incorrect positions, and incorrect letters. the getHint method compares each letter of the guessed word with the corresponding letter of the hidden word. Based on the comparison results, it constructs a hint string that indicates correct letters in their correct positions, correct letters in incorrect positions, and incorrect letters. Finally, it returns the hint string."

    "### Reflections and Key Learning\n",
    "I learned about encapsulation through the HiddenWord class, where I kept the word attribute private and provided a public method getHint() to interact with it. This approach promotes good object-oriented design by hiding internal implementation details and providing a clear interface for interacting with the class. Another skill which I developed was String manipulation, this exercise required significant string manipulation, including accessing characters in a string using the charAt() method, checking if a string contains a specific character with the contains() method, and building a new string using a StringBuilder. Thirdly, I improved my Conditional Logic abilities, in the getHint() method, I used conditional statements (if-else) to determine the hint for the guessed word. By checking each character of the guessed word against the corresponding character in the hidden word, I adjusted the hint accordingly. Lastly, I became more proficient at Debugging and Testing, the main method served as the test for the HiddenWord class, providing various input cases and verifying the correctness of the getHint() method's output.\n"
