    "This exercise reinforced my understanding of working with 2D arrays in Java. In the provided code, mat1 and mat2 are 2D arrays of integers, each representing a matrix. Manipulating and iterating over 2D arrays is a fundamental skill in Java programming, and this exercise provided an opportunity to practice it. Another thing was The use of the HashSet data structure in the isDiverse method demonstrated the importance of selecting the appropriate data structure for the task at hand. In this case, a HashSet was chosen to efficiently store unique row sums. This choice allowed for constant-time insertion and lookup operations, ensuring an efficient solution to the problem of checking array diversity. Lastly, overall my algorithmic thinking has deeply increased for example: the problem of determining whether a 2D array is diverse requires algorithmic thinking. The isDiverse method employs a simple algorithm to iterate over each row of the array, calculate the sum of its elements, and check if the sum is unique using a set. This exercise encouraged me to think algorithmically and develop a solution to the problem using basic programming constructs.\n"
