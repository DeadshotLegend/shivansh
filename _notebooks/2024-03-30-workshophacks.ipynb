    "Question 1: Primitive Types vs Reference Types (Unit 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Situation: You are developing a banking application where you need to represent customer information. You have decided to use both primitive types and reference types for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Define primitive types and reference types in Java. Provide examples of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primitive types in Java are the basic data types provided by the language itself. They hold simple values and are not objects. Examples include int, double, boolean, char, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Explain the differences between primitive types and reference types in terms of memory allocation and usage in Java programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference types, on the other hand, are complex data types that are defined by classes in Java. They hold references (memory addresses) to objects stored in the heap memory. Examples include objects of classes like String, ArrayList, Customer, etc. Primitive types are allocated memory on the stack, and their values are stored directly. Reference types are allocated memory on the heap, and variables of reference types hold references (memory addresses) to the actual objects stored in the heap.\n",
    "Primitive types are used for simple data storage and manipulation. Reference types are used to represent complex objects and enable more sophisticated behavior through methods and inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a method `calculateInterest` that takes a primitive `double` type representing the principal amount and a reference type `Customer` representing the customer information. Write  the method signature and the method implementation. Include comments to explain your code.\n"

    "\n",
    "Iteration over a 2D array in Java involves traversing through each element of the array, row by row and column by column, to perform certain operations or access the values stored in the array. This process involves nested loops, where one loop iterates over the rows and another loop iterates over the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example scenario:\n",
    "Suppose you are developing a program to calculate the average score of students in a classroom where each student has taken multiple exams. You store the scores in a 2D array where each row represents a student, and each column represents an exam. Iterating over this 2D array allows you to access each individual score and calculate the average score for each student or the average score for each exam across all students. This iteration is useful for statistical analysis or generating reports based on the exam scores.\n",
