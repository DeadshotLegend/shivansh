I feel like my use of projects has helped me get used to interacting with Using Objects, and Inheritance. The different lessons that were presented in class helped me get used to Iteration, Recursion, Array, and ArrayLists.\n",

    "This is the only question that I got wrong in the collegeboard MCQ quiz, and this was a mistake in order of operations and mathematics. I understood all the math symbols and tried to attmept the problem but I got it wrong. Now lookiong back at it, I think that this mistake could have been avoided with multiple rechecks and reviewing the problem multiple times."

To get better understanding of the question I went online and researched different boolean methods and various methods which take in String paramters. Eventually I was able to solve the problem and get the correct answer.\n"

    "This question is extremely complicated for me since I was not very well versed with booleans and especially compound booleans with two different variables, x and y. I spent a lot of time researching how compound booleans work and spent a lot of time on the internet learning how to solve compound boolean problems. In the end, not only did I get the answer correct but got a better overall understanding of using compound booleans which can be used in later projects."

Also iteration on binary search was something that I only did once in a lesson and I still wasn't very comfortable with doing it as I haven't implemented it within other projects. \n"
