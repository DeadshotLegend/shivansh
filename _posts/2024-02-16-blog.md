# How you used N@tM to capture test data to be used in trimester 3 from feedback, something you will add to your project other?

We got a lot of feedback from students and adults such as Mr. Lopez

What looked good:
- Functioning chat system
- AI Chatbot looked good and it queried from GPT and stored in Database 
- Creating new channel

What We can improve on:
- The constnat flashing on the chat to always update it dosen't look good and we should set up a system where it will only reload when there is a new message

We can do this by using a Socket

# Blog / article on you and team and reflection on glows/grows from your demo/presentations
The initial assessment of our system yielded several positive aspects, including a fully functioning chat system that seamlessly facilitated communication between users. Additionally, the AI Chatbot performed admirably, seamlessly querying information from GPT and efficiently storing it in the database for future reference. Another notable achievement was the successful implementation of a feature enabling users to create new channels, enhancing the platform's versatility and user experience. However, upon closer inspection, it became evident that there were areas for improvement. One glaring issue was the constant flashing of the chat interface, which appeared to prompt users to update the chat unnecessarily. To address this, we propose implementing a more streamlined system whereby the chat interface reloads only when there is a new message. This can be achieved through the integration of a Socket, which will allow for real-time updates without the disruptive flashing, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience.
