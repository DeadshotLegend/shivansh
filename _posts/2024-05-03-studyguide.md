- Objects and classes as ways to describe instances, attributes, and behaviors
- Creating objects by calling constructors with and without parameters
- Utilizing class libraries, including Integer and Double
- Defining an object’s behavior using methods, including static and Math class
- Calling non-static void methods with and without parameters
- Using String objects and methods

### Unit 3: Boolean Expressions and If Statements
- Finding Boolean values with expressions involving relational operators
- Using conditional statements to execute different statements based on input values
- Building on conditional statements to create multiple possible outcomes
- Creating the same value using equivalent Boolean expressions

### Unit 4: Iteration
Creating a loop to run an expression repeatedly until certain conditions are met
Standard arithmetic-based and String algorithms
Representing iterative processes in code using for and while loops
Nesting loop and iteration statements

### Unit 5: Writing Classes
The makeup of a class, including whether attributes are public or private
Setting an object’s attributes using constructors
Using comments to describe the functionality of code
Defining behaviors of an object using non-void, void, and static methods
